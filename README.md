# LFI-Vulnerability-Scanner
This script first defines a list of filenames that are commonly used to test for LFI vulnerabilities. It then defines the base URL to test (which should be the URL of the page that is vulnerable to LFI), and iterates over the list of filenames. For each filename, the script constructs the full URL to test by appending the filename to the base URL. It then makes an HTTP GET request to the full URL using the requests library, and checks the response status code. If the status code is 200, it means that the file was successfully included, and the script prints a message indicating that an LFI vulnerability was found. If the status code is not 200, it means that the file was not included, and the script prints a message indicating that no LFI vulnerability was found.

Note that this script is intended as a basic example, and may not be able to detect all LFI vulnerabilities in a given URL. It is recommended to use a more comprehensive testing tool or method when conducting a thorough security assessment.
